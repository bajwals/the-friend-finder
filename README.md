## Usage
    Navigate to localhost:8080 to get to the homepage, which will have a button to start the survey. Once started, you'll be taken to the survey page where you will fill out answers to questions on a scale. Once entered, the API will send your survey data in an array to a listener which will compare your data to that which already exists in a friends.js file under /data. After comparing the results, you will be matched with one of the Smith sisters.
